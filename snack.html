    <h2>snack</h2>
    <p> A <strong><u>snack</u></strong> is a small service of food and generally eaten between meals.</p><p style="marjin-top:50px;">
        Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home.
        Traditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation.
        Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks.
        The Dagwood sandwich was originally the humorous result of a cartoon character's desire for large snacks.
        With the spread of convenience stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business.
